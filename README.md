# Day 1 Challenge
This challenge consists of two Activities, each with a TextView and a Button. Activity A loads by default, with the TextView set to a random number. If the user clicks the Button on Activity A, a number is randomly generated, put into an intent, then passed to Activity B, which is then started. Once Activity B loads, the TextView is set to the random number that was passed through the intent. If the user clicks the Button on Activity B, then same behavior is demonstrated back to Activity A.
